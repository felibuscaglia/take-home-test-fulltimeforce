# ðŸ”Ž Commit Tracker

This application will allow you to see all the commits that were made to the repository throughout the development of the application. You will be able to know how long ago they were made, what was modified and who did it, thanks to the GitHub REST API (https://docs.github.com/en/resthttps://docs.github.com/en/rest).

## ðŸ“¦ Preliminary steps and installation

The first thing you should do is clone this repository locally on your computer. For that, click on the green button that I show you below and follow the steps.

Once that is done, open your terminal and go to the location of your newly cloned repository. From your terminal, write the following command, which will install all the dependencies of the project.

```bash
npm install
```

Once you have installed all the packages that will allow you to run the application correctly, the only thing left to do, always from the terminal and in the repository location, is to write the following command

```bash
npm start
```

This will host the application on a local server on port 3000, if you don't have it in use for something else. Once the command is executed, a tab should be generated in your default browser where you can access the app. In case that doesn't happen, just type this address (http://localhost:3000/) in any browser.
